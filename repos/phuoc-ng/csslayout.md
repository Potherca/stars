### `phuoc-ng/csslayout`

{% github phuoc-ng/csslayout %}

If you want to jump-start your proof-of-concepts, prototypes or UI work, "UI design patterns" will most likely be a term you are familiar with. https://csslayout.io/ will be a welcome addition to your toolchain.

Since it started in November 2019, it has already ammassed more than 90 patterns and more are keep being added. It has common use-cases for layout, navigation, input, display, and feedback.

I expected you will here about this effort through other channels soon, so keep an eye out for it!
