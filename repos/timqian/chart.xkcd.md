### chart.xkcd

{% github timqian/chart.xkcd %}

I really like the XKCD comics and I am rather fond of charts, so when I saw that somebody had combined both to create a XKCD styled chart library, obviosuly, that's gonna get starred...

Why would you use this? (Other than for fun) Well, there is imperical evidence that there is a large benefit to use a more "sketchy" look for projects that are still under heavy development. So the next time you need to demo an application that has graphs, but don't want to give people the idea that everything is production ready, use this.
