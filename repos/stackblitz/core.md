### Stackblitz

{% github stackblitz/core %}

Ever since they came out, I've been using online integrated development environments (IDE). Currently I use [Cloud9][4] (part of the Amazon stable of products since their acquisition in 2016).

As it pays to have alternatives ready, https://stackblitz.com/ piqued my interest. Especially since it is powered by Visual Studio Code!
