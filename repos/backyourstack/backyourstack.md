### Back your stack

In software development, _everybody_ is dependant on open-source. Sadly, most developers and companies don't give back to the community they rely on.

One of the barriers is that, often, people don't know who to support, or _how_. [BackYourStack](https://backyourstack.com/) aims to remove that hurdle.

BackYourStack offers a service that scans all the repositories of an organization (or user) on Github. It then analyzes all the open-source software dependencies it finds. Next, it provides a direct link to ways those projects can be supported.

Say, for instance, we use NPM a lot and would like to contribute to the eco-system NPM uses. We can simply visit https://backyourstack.com/npm and see all of the dependencies NPM relies on.

Currently https://backyourstack.com/ is in beta and only [OpenCollective][2] seems to be supported. Nevertheless, this service seems really promising, so I starred the accompanying repo.
