### Gun

{% github amark/gun %}

For an experiment I was doing, I wanted peer-to-peer (P2P) communication. After going through a short-list of possible candidates, GUN attracked me most.

> GUN is an ecosystem of tools that let you build community run and encrypted applications.

It is currently used in production by some large players like [the Internet Archive][1] and [HackerNoon][2].

After some initial reading, things where suprisingly easy to work with and (using the provided "Deploy on Heroku" button) very easy to set up.

As part of my ongoing fascination with the distributed web, I plan to come back to GUN for some of my future projects.
