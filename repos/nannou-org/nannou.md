### Nannou

{% github nannou-org/nannou %}

I have a lot of fun creating animated drawing with Processing (You can see some of my creations at https://www.openprocessing.org/user/190336/#sketches).

[Nannou][3] is an alternative to Processing, written in Rust.

I am not aware of an online editing environment for it (yet), but since the whole thing is written in Rust, it'll only be a matter of time before someone compiles it to Web Assembly and created one.

Or maybe I'll have a stab at it myself, if there's nothing there by 2021. Regardless, something to keep in mind. Star!
