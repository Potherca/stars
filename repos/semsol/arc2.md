### `semsol/arc2`

Besides everything else I've got going on, I am also delving into the distributed web. If you don't know what that means, think of it as the internet without silos (like Google, Facebook, Amazon, or your ISP) having _total_ control over any part of it. In the distributed web, all parts can be swapped out at your choice.

Where I was looking at the [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)][4] a couple of months ago, my attention is currently on [Solid][5]. In a nutshell, Solid would allow you to manage your data and authentication yourself. Other services (like Google, Facebook, and Amazon) would then connect to _your_ data or login provider, rather than those things being with _them_.

This topic has lead me to star more repos before, and although the star-storm that started in week 17 has settled down, I found another semi-relevant repo.

Part of Solid is file (meta)data, like RDF. [ARC2][6] is a PHP7 library for working with RDF. It also provides a MySQL-based triplestore with SPARQL support. If that sounds too technical or boring to you, it probably is and you can safely ignore this repo.

For me, it held an interest, so it got starred.
