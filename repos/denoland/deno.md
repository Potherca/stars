### Deno

If you are a web or NodeJS developer, chances are that you've heard about [the `v1.0.0` release of Deno][3] earlier this month. In case you haven't, Deno is:

> A secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript.

It isn't meant to be a drop-in-replacement for NodeJS, it is a completely **new** runtime, written in Rust.

Last week I finally got around to reading up on this new creation by the original developer behind NodeJS and it is looking real good. It isn't feature-complete enough to push NodeJS from its throne soon, but in the long run it could become a viable (easier and faster) alternative to run server-side JS.

Visit https://deno.land/ and read up if you haven't yet. Regardless, that gotta be starred!
