### `testdouble/test-smells`

{% github testdouble/test-smells %}

As much as it is important to know how to do things _right_, it is more educational to understand what makes things _wrong_.

This repository will help you do just that:

> This repository is designed to serve as a sandbox for exploring a handful of test smells that are common in real-world test suites.

Originally written for workshops given by the [Test Double][5] agency, it is now available for all.

If you want to learn more about what makes a test a bad one: Visit that repo!
