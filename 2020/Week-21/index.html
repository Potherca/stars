        title: Back your stack
        —</p>
      <h3 id="back-your-stack">Back your stack</h3>
      <p>In software development, <em>everybody</em> is dependant on open-source. Sadly, most developers and companies don’t give back to the community they rely on.</p>
      <p>One of the barriers is that, often, people don’t know who to support, or <em>how</em>. <a href="https://backyourstack.com/">BackYourStack</a> aims to remove that hurdle.</p>
      <p>BackYourStack offers a service that scans all the repositories of an organization (or user) on Github. It then analyzes all the open-source software dependencies it finds. Next, it provides a direct link to ways those projects can be supported.</p>
      <p>Say, for instance, we use NPM a lot and would like to contribute to the eco-system NPM uses. We can simply visit https://backyourstack.com/npm and see all of the dependencies NPM relies on.</p>
      <p>Currently https://backyourstack.com/ is in beta and only <a href="https://opencollective.com/">OpenCollective</a> seems to be supported. Nevertheless, this service seems really promising, so I starred the accompanying repo.</p>

      <h3 id="deno">Deno</h3>
      <p>If you are a web or NodeJS developer, chances are that you’ve heard about <a href="https://deno.land/v1">the <code class="highlighter-rouge">v1.0.0</code> release of Deno</a> earlier this month. In case you haven’t, Deno is:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>A secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>It isn’t meant to be a drop-in-replacement for NodeJS, it is a completely <strong>new</strong> runtime, written in Rust.</p>
      <p>Last week I finally got around to reading up on this new creation by the original developer behind NodeJS and it is looking real good. It isn’t feature-complete enough to push NodeJS from its throne soon, but in the long run it could become a viable (easier and faster) alternative to run server-side JS.</p>
      <p>Visit https://deno.land/ and read up if you haven’t yet. Regardless, that gotta be starred!</p>

      <h3 id="how-they-test">How They Test</h3>
      <p>Have you ever wonder which path has led some of the major players to their current quality culture? On
        https://abhivaikar.github.io/howtheytest/, you can find all of the blog posts, articles and other resources that describe just that. Usually you would have to scour the internet to try and get a coherent picture, but no more! How They Test has gathered these resources for you and grouped them together for companies like Airbnb, Amazon, Apple, and Atlassian. And that’s just the “A”!</p>
      <p>As not to forget to come back to those resources, this repo got starred!</p>

      <h3 id="semsolarc2"><code class="highlighter-rouge">semsol/arc2</code></h3>
      <p>Besides everything else I’ve got going on, I am also delving into the distributed web. If you don’t know what that means, think of it as the internet without silos (like Google, Facebook, Amazon, or your ISP) having <em>total</em> control over any part of it. In the distributed web, all parts can be swapped out at your choice.</p>
      <p>Where I was looking at the <a href="https://ipfs.io/">InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)</a> a couple of months ago, my attention is currently on <a href="https://solid.mit.edu/">Solid</a>. In a nutshell, Solid would allow you to manage your data and authentication yourself. Other services (like Google, Facebook, and Amazon) would then connect to <em>your</em> data or login provider, rather than those things being with <em>them</em>.</p>
      <p>This topic has lead me to star more repos before, and although the star-storm that started in week 17 has settled down, I found another semi-relevant repo.</p>
      <p>Part of Solid is file (meta)data, like RDF. <a href="https://github.com/semsol/arc2">ARC2</a> is a PHP7 library for working with RDF. It also provides a MySQL-based triplestore with SPARQL support. If that sounds too technical or boring to you, it probably is and you can safely ignore this repo.</p>
      <p>For me, it held an interest, so it got starred.</p>

        <li>I’ve narrowed things down to three companies. With a bit of luck I’ll be making a final decision in the coming week.</li>
