## A constellation of stars

Software development is a large part of my daily life. Not just the things I create myself. I also enjoy staying up to date with events in my field and discovering new tools, apps, services and techniques.

Keeping everything organised can be quite a hassle, simply because there is just _so_ much to discover.

One of the ways I keep track of interesting things I have discovered, is by using the "star" feature on Github. Whenever there is something I want to keep track of, I look for the source code repository on Github. If there is one, I "star" it, so I can easily find it again later.

To give you an idea of how prolific I am with staring repos: in the 3764 days since [I joined Github](https://github.com/Potherca?tab=overview&from=2010-12-01&to=2010-12-31), I have starred [more than 2500 repositories](https://github.com/stars/Potherca).

## Who watches the starwatchers

Some time ago, a colleague of mine at Takeaway ([@webbertakken](https://github.com/webbertakken)) told me that he enjoys seeing what kind of things I have discovered (and starred). He was a little disapointed, though, that there wasn't really any way for him to figure out **why** I had starred a certain repo.

His comment gave me the idea to write a sentence or two for each repo I star. At the time it was just one idea of many floating around.

## Lift off!

This week, however, I finally had enough time and energy to make a first attempt. Now, I am proud to present to you: **Potherca's Weekly Github Stars**

Every week (most likely after the weekend), I'll be posting to [dev.to][1] which Github repositories I have starred. I'll also explain a bit about _why_ I starred a specific repository and provide some background details.

So, if you want to know what is going on in my world, development wise, you can now follow along. üëç
