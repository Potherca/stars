      <p>Software development is a large part of my daily life. Not just the things I create myself. I also enjoy staying up to date with events in my field and discovering new tools, apps, services and techniques.</p>
      <p>Keeping everything organised can be quite a hassle, simply because there is just <em>so</em> much to discover.</p>
      <p>One of the ways I keep track of interesting things I have discovered, is by using the ‚Äústar‚Äù feature on Github. Whenever there is something I want to keep track of, I look for the source code repository on Github. If there is one, I ‚Äústar‚Äù it, so I can easily find it again later.</p>
      <p>To give you an idea of how prolific I am with staring repos: in the 3764 days since <a href="https://github.com/Potherca?tab=overview&amp;from=2010-12-01&amp;to=2010-12-31">I joined Github</a>, I have starred <a href="https://github.com/stars/Potherca">more than 2500 repositories</a>.</p>
      <h2 id="who-watches-the-starwatchers">Who watches the starwatchers</h2>
      <p>Some time ago, a colleague of mine at Takeaway (<a href="https://github.com/webbertakken">@webbertakken</a>) told me that he enjoys seeing what kind of things I have discovered (and starred). He was a little disapointed, though, that there wasn‚Äôt really any way for him to figure out <strong>why</strong> I had starred a certain repo.</p>
      <p>His comment gave me the idea to write a sentence or two for each repo I star. At the time it was just one idea of many floating around.</p>
      <h2 id="lift-off">Lift off!</h2>
      <p>This week, however, I finally had enough time and energy to make a first attempt. Now, I am proud to present to you: <strong>Potherca‚Äôs Weekly Github Stars</strong></p>
      <p>Every week (most likely after the weekend), I‚Äôll be posting to <a href="https://dev.to">dev.to</a> which Github repositories I have starred. I‚Äôll also explain a bit about <em>why</em> I starred a specific repository and provide some background details.</p>
      <p>So, if you want to know what is going on in my world, development wise, you can now follow along. üëç</p>
