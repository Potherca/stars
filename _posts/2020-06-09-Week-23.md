Last week I worked on my submission for the [Grant For The Web Hackathon on DEV][1].

In case you missed it **[the deadline for the hackathon has been extended to June 14th]**.

My submission is an idea about Web Monetization for Games.<sup>1</sup> As such, most of last weeks stars are related to Web Monetization and Games.

## Last week's starred repos

### Awesome Web Monetization

{% github thomasbnt/awesome-web-monetization %}

One of the awesome submissions to the hackathon was by [Thomas Bnt][2].

He made an "[Awesome List][3]" for Web Monetization. Worth checking out!

### CodeLani

{% github codelani/codelani %}

Along the way, I stumbled across [CodeLani][4]. This project holds all sorts of information about _many_ programming language. plain text format, or binary specifications. Combining [various sources][5], it is great for quickly looking up background information, without having to scan an entire Wikipedia page.

The [page for Javascript][6], for instance, gives us a quick overview showing Javascript:

- is 25 Years Old
- has 6,985,336 Users
- ranks in the top 1% of languages
- was created by Brendan Eich

Great for research!

### Dwitter

{%github lionleaf/dwitter %}

This is one has nothing to do with games or monitization.

[Dwitter][7] is a social network for short js demos.

It is a way developers to demonstrate their work in response to the site's challenge:

> see what [..] you can create [with] only 140 characters of javascript and a canvas.

I discovered it after a tweet that did just that:

{% twitter 1268820823952916486 %}

So much cool work there.

### Js13kGames

{% github js13kGames/resources %}

A previous hackathon that the [Grant for the Web][8] was involved with was [the 2019 edition of the Js13kGames][9].

The [Js13kGames][10] is a competition that challenges participants to develop a game that does not exceed 13 kilobytes of code.

Started in 2012, it takes place every year on the 13th of August, so mark this year in your calendar!

The repository I starred list all sorts of usefull resources regarding JS game development.

Visit https://js13kgames.github.io/resources/ to see them all.

### RedHoodJT1988/endless-runner

{% github RedHoodJT1988/endless-runner %}

This is another entry in the hackathon.

{% post https://dev.to/redhoodjt1988/placeholder-title-4fo1 %}

One reason that I starred this, is because it is a _game_ that has something to do with _monetization_. Another reason is just  because it is a fun way to waiste some time.

The game can be played at https://run-goblin-run.netlify.app/

Give it a go!

### Repo Ranger

{% github reporanger/default %}

Something else I discovered last week is [Repo Ranger][11].

It is a project by [Michael Fix][12] (one of the creators [Carbon][13], source code to images generator)

Repo Ranger is a bot that automates various tasks to help repository maintainers with menial tasks like:

- Closing Issues
- Commenting on Threads
- Creating Tags after Merging
- Deleting Comments
- Deleting Merged Branches
- Merging PRs

And it works well in combination with other bots.

As the source-code is not (yet?) open-sourced, I starred the config repo as not to forget about this tool.

Currently still in beta, something to keep an eye on!

### Weather Font

{% github Weatherfonts/weather-font %}

Another off-topic entry for last weeks theme. 

In 2013, [Erik Flowers][14] created an amazing set of weather icons. Since then the project has grown to more than two-hundred icons. Sadly, since 2017, [the project is no longer maintained][15].

More recently, however, there has been some talk about reviving the project. As the repo I starred already set up https://weatherfont.com/, odds are looking good that this might be the rallying point of this new effort.

We'll see...

## Closing notes

That wraps up last weeks stars. Because of the hackathon, there is more of a theme to this post's stars, which I like.

Maybe I should change the format from "weekly" to a more cohesive "themed" format... Something to think about.

Until next week, stay healthy, stay safe. ðŸ‘‹
