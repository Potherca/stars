## This week's starred repos

### Cascadia Code Font

{% github microsoft/cascadia-code %}

I've always had an interest in typography, design and the effect they have on my development environment (and thus my developer hapiness). Part of this is developer fonts.

This week I came across a font by Microsoft that I was not yet familiar with: Cascadia Code. First released in July 2019, it looks like this:

 ![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/euoa5wzy8wuzjckvzpb7.png)

I haven't tried it in my development setup yet, but I plan to try it out ASAP!

### chart.xkcd

{% github timqian/chart.xkcd %}

I really like the XKCD comics and I am rather fond of charts, so when I saw that somebody had combined both to create a XKCD styled chart library, obviosuly, that's gonna get starred...

Why would you use this? (Other than for fun) Well, there is imperical evidence that there is a large benefit to use a more "sketchy" look for projects that are still under heavy development. So the next time you need to demo an application that has graphs, but don't want to give people the idea that everything is production ready, use this.

### GitPitch

{% github gitpitch/gitpitch %}

As I give talks, I make slides. I am always on the lookout for text-based slide deck libraries. Currently I use https://revealjs.com/ but when I came across https://gitpitch.com/ I figured it might be worth looking into. Hence: star!

### Godot Gaming Engine

{% github godotengine/godot %}

Every now and then, I think that it might be fun to create a computer game. I never _do_ but it does keep me on the lookout for 100% open-source (and hopefully easy to use) gaming engines.

The Godot Engine seems to match this description, so I starred it for future reference.

### `google/robotstxt`

{% github google/robotstxt %}

This week, the news came by that Google had released the source-code of their `Robots.txt` parse. Not of huge interest, but large enough to warrant a star, methinks.


### Gun

{% github amark/gun %}

For an experiment I was doing, I wanted peer-to-peer (P2P) communication. After going through a short-list of possible candidates, GUN attracked me most.

> GUN is an ecosystem of tools that let you build community run and encrypted applications.

It is currently used in production by some large players like [the Internet Archive][1] and [HackerNoon][2].

After some initial reading, things where suprisingly easy to work with and (using the provided "Deploy on Heroku" button) very easy to set up.

As part of my ongoing fascination with the distributed web, I plan to come back to GUN for some of my future projects.

Official website: https://gun.eco/

### Nannou

{% github nannou-org/nannou %}

I have a lot of fun creating animated drawing with Processing (You can see some of my creations at https://www.openprocessing.org/user/190336/#sketches).

[Nannou][3] is an alternative to Processing, written in Rust.

I am not aware of an online editing environment for it (yet), but since the whole thing is written in Rust, it'll only be a matter of time before someone compiles it to Web Assembly and created one.

Or maybe I'll have a stab at it myself, if there's nothing there by 2021. Regardless, something to keep in mind. Star!

### `nwtgck/gh-card`

{% github nwtgck/gh-card %}

You know those "card" UI elements that you see on Github for every repository? This is a simple (yet effective) tool that creates such a card for you. Just:

1. Visit https://gh-card.dev/
2. Fill in a project name (user/repo)
3. Press "Generate"
4. Copy/Paste the markdown
5. Done!

The card image is available as PNG or SVG image.

For the project itself, the card look like this:
[![nwtgck/gh-card - GitHub](https://gh-card.dev/repos/nwtgck/gh-card.png)](https://github.com/nwtgck/gh-card)

Nifty! ⭐

### `phuoc-ng/csslayout`

{% github phuoc-ng/csslayout %}

If you want to jump-start your proof-of-concepts, prototypes or UI work, "UI design patterns" will most likely be a term you are familiar with. https://csslayout.io/ will be a welcome addition to your toolchain.

Since it started in November 2019, it has already ammassed more than 90 patterns and more are keep being added. It has common use-cases for layout, navigation, input, display, and feedback.

I expected you will here about this effort through other channels soon, so keep an eye out for it!

### Stackblitz

{% github stackblitz/core %}

Ever since they came out, I've been using online integrated development environments (IDE). Currently I use [Cloud9][4] (part of the Amazon stable of products since their acquisition in 2016).

As it pays to have alternatives ready, https://stackblitz.com/ piqued my interest. Especially since it is powered by Visual Studio Code!

### StateOfCSS-2019

{% github StateOfJS/StateOfCSS-2019 %}

When the results of the 2019 State of CSS survey came out, I didn't really have the time/energy to go through them. This week I did.

It would be too much to go through all of it here, but I would like to share this:

![](https://2019.stateofcss.com/images/captures/technologies_tools-scatterplot.png)

If you haven't already, I would advise you to have a look for yourself: https://2019.stateofcss.com/

### `testdouble/test-smells`

{% github testdouble/test-smells %}

As much as it is important to know how to do things _right_, it is more educational to understand what makes things _wrong_.

This repository will help you do just that:

> This repository is designed to serve as a sandbox for exploring a handful of test smells that are common in real-world test suites.

Originally written for workshops given by the [Test Double][5] agency, it is now available for all.

If you want to learn more about what makes a test a bad one: Visit that repo!

## Closing notes

You might be wondering what the common thread between this weeks rather mixed bag of goodies is. To a large extent, this is caused by me spending more time on Twitter. That is where part of this weeks stars came from.
