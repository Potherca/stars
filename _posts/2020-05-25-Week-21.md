title: Week 21
---

As I was still rather busy with [my jobhunt][1] this week<sup>1</sup>, I did not do much browsing and developing. For that reason there are only four repos of interest.

## This week's starred repos

{% include_repo backyourstack/backyourstack %}

{% include_repo denoland/deno %}

{% include_repo abhivaikar/howtheytest %}

{% include_repo semsol/arc2 %}

## Closing notes

That was all for this week. See you next time!

## Footnotes

1. I've narrowed things down to three companies. With a bit of luck I'll be making a final decision in the coming week.
